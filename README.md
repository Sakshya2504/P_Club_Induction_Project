Task-4: Front-End Development (Medium)

Title: Crypto Price Tracker

Domain: Web

Description:

I used Vite as a server and write my code on React.
For fetching the data I used Binance API instead CoinGecko or CoinMarketCap API as I was facing the problem while fetching the data and 
and I found Binance more easy to use.
To represent the pictorial gragh I used react-chartjs-2 and chart.js/auto,import in App.jsx using ES Module.

Steps to Run the Code:

Step 1 :Run these commands in Text Editor's Terminal
      npm create vite@latest
      npm i

Step 2:Replace the App.jsx and App.css code with code uploaded in the github repository and remove all styling of index.css 
       These all files are in src folder.

Step 3:Run this commands in Text Editor's Terminal
       npm run dev

Step 4:Click on the give link simultaneously click with ctrl button.
      It will direct to the web page via browser.
      If does not work then
      open Browser 
      search using search bar
      localhost:5173
